📊 Splunk SIEM Investigation

Blue Team Project — Log Analysis, Threat Detection & Incident Response

This project demonstrates hands-on SOC analyst skills using Splunk, including:

Log ingestion & parsing

Threat hunting with SPL queries

Identifying brute-force attacks & suspicious login activity

Investigating Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
